Event-Generator
===============

This code uses simulates electron ion collisions, including the cross angle, as well as a D(e,e'p_recoil)X cross 
section calculation. The output of this code is setup to be passed to the full detector simulation. This code has 
been cross checked against a fixed target code, found in the toolbox directory, where in the limit of a zero momentum 
hardon, both codes give the same answer.  Detailed documentaion for the event generator can be found at 
https://github.com/JeffersonLab/LightIonEIC/blob/master/Event-Generator/Documenation/STEGs.pdf.

Basic Configuration
--------------------

0/ ./Set_Configure
-> set the configuration of ROOT and PATH

1/ ./RunSTEG_PhaseSpace.exe
-> generate event in the phase-space

2/ ./MainRunEIC_STEG.exe
-> event is weighted by cross-section with given physics model
