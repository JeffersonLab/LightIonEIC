Semi-Inclusive Theory Codes
---------------------------

The physics codes found here are included with the event generator.   The code from Misak Sargsian was developed prior to this project
and is valid for xB>0.2 physics while the codes from Chirstian Weiss were developed as part of the project to be a modular code
to be valid over the enter kinematic range of a future Electron Ion Collider.   More details about these code, as well as other theory
work that has been done as part of this project, can be found at https://www.jlab.org/theory/tag/physics.html.
