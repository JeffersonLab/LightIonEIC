Polarized & unpolarized light ions will play a major role in the physics program of an electron ion collider.   In this git repository, the codes that are being used to study the electron light-ion collision are stored and documented. 

Fixed-Target - The fixed target code uses Misak's D(e,e'p_recoil)X code within a fixed target Monte Carlo.  This code
can be is to test the collider code where in the limit of a zero momentum hardon, both codes should give the same answer.

Hyde - The Hyde directory contains code to calculate the electron-ion collision in the lab frame and then boost to a frame where the ion has zero momentum.   This "fix target" frame is useful for many codes.   The code can also do the transformation back to the lab frame.
