This is a sort of technical note (or README) with a bit more detail explanation. 
A very briefly explanation for running codes is that taking two steps. 
Go to the directory named ./source_codes2_for_git_hub_final/. 
Execute 

(1) ``RunPhaseSpace.exe'', then 

(2) ``MainRunEIC\_Lund.exe''. 

These steps allow you to obtain outputs (LUND, Ntuples) under ./lund_out/ ./ednt10/, 
then you can run your own analysis code to make plots.
